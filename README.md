# Cybersecurity Learning & Practical Labs

This repository documents my hands-on journey into cybersecurity through practical labs, notes, and small projects. The focus is on **understanding how systems work, how they break, and how to think like a defender and attacker**, rather than just completing theory.

## 🔐 What this repository includes

- Practical labs and walkthroughs inspired by **TryHackMe**
- Notes on:
  - Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, ports, services)
  - Linux and Windows basics
  - Authentication, permissions, and system hardening
  - Common attack techniques mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK**
- Security concepts such as:
  - Phishing and social engineering
  - Brute-force and credential abuse
  - Privilege escalation basics
  - Log analysis and incident thinking
- Small scripts, configurations, and write-ups used for learning and experimentation

This repository reflects **active learning**, not just finished content. Some sections show progress, experimentation, and problem-solving steps.

## 🧪 Platforms & Tools Used

- TryHackMe (hands-on labs and guided rooms)
- Linux (Ubuntu/Kali)
- Windows environments
- Basic networking tools
- GitHub for documentation and version control

## 🌐 Supporting Technical Skills

Alongside cybersecurity, I have experience working on **frontend and backend web projects**, which helps with:
- Understanding how web applications function
- Identifying common security weaknesses
- Thinking about real-world attack surfaces
- Writing cleaner, more security-aware code

Technologies used include:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend fundamentals and application logic
- Basic deployment and troubleshooting

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Demonstrate practical cybersecurity learning
- Show consistency and hands-on effort
- Build a portfolio for **IT Support / Service Desk / Junior Cybersecurity roles**
- Track growth over time rather than pretending to know everything

## 📈 Current Focus

- Strengthening networking and system fundamentals
- Expanding hands-on cybersecurity labs
- Improving documentation and write-ups
- Preparing for entry-level IT and cybersecurity roles in Australia
